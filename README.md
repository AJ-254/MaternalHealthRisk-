# Maternal Health Risk App - AI Workflow 🩺

## Overview  
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to predict **maternal health risks** based on clinical indicators such as blood pressure, blood sugar, age, temperature, and heart rate. The goal is to design a machine learning workflow that helps healthcare professionals identify high-risk cases early — ultimately supporting safer pregnancies and improved maternal outcomes.

---

## Objectives  
- To preprocess and analyze maternal health data for better understanding of risk factors.  
- To train an AI model that classifies patients into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** risk categories.  
- To demonstrate the use of **Streamlit** for visualizing predictions interactively.  
- To link the solution to **UN SDG 3: Good Health & Well-being**, focusing on maternal safety.

---

## Dataset  
A publicly available *Maternal Health Risk Dataset* from **Kaggle** is used for this workflow.  
Each record includes:
- Age  
- Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure  
- Blood Sugar  
- Body Temperature  
- Heart Rate  
- Risk Level (target variable)

---

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   - Handle missing values, detect outliers, and visualize key patterns.  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Normalize and prepare features for model training.  
3. **Model Training**  
   - Use classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
5. **Streamlit Integration**  
   - Build an intuitive UI to input patient data and visualize predictions.

## Expected Outcome  
A reliable machine learning model that predicts maternal risk levels with high interpretability and can be integrated into mobile or web health platforms. This project demonstrates how AI can strengthen maternal healthcare in resource-limited environments.
